Fit generalized linear mixed model with known relationship matrices
}
\description{
Fit a generalized linear mixed model with a random intercept. The covariance matrix of the random intercept is proportional to a known relationship matrix (e.g. kinship matrix in genetic association studies). Alternatively, it can be a variance components model with multiple random effects, and each component has a known relationship matrix.
}
\usage{
glmmkin(fixed, data = parent.frame(), kins, 
	family = binomial(link = "logit"), method = "REML", 
	method.optim = "AI", maxiter = 500, tol = 1e-5, taumin = 1e-5, 
	taumax = 1e5, tauregion = 10, verbose = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{fixed}{
an object of class \code{\link{formula}} (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the fixed effects model to be fitted.
}
  \item{data}{
a data frame or list (or object coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}} to a data frame) containing the variables in the model.
}
  \item{kins}{
a known relationship matrix (e.g. kinship matrix in genetic association studies) or a list of known relationship matrices. When supplied with a matrix, this matrix should be a positive semi-definite matrix with dimensions equal to the sample size in \code{data}, and the order of subjects in this matrix should also match the order of subjects in \code{data}. When supplied with a list of matrices, each matrix should be a positive semi-definite matrix with dimensions equal to the sample size in \code{data}, and the order of subjects in each matrix should also match the order of subjects in \code{data}. Currently there is no ID checking feature implemented, and it is the user's responsibility to match the orders.
}
  \item{family}{
a description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. This can be a character string naming a family function, a family function or the result of a call to a family function. (See \code{\link{family}} for details of family functions.)
}
  \item{method}{
method of fitting the generalized linear mixed model. Either "REML" or "ML" (default = "REML").
}
  \item{method.optim}{
optimization method of fitting the generalized linear mixed model. Either "AI", "Brent" or "Nelder-Mead" (default = "AI").
}
  \item{maxiter}{
a positive integer specifying the maximum number of iterations when fitting the generalized linear mixed model (default = 500).
}
  \item{tol}{
a positive number specifying tolerance, the difference threshold for parameter estimates below which iterations should be stopped (default = 1e-5).
}
  \item{taumin}{
the lower bound of search space for the variance component parameter \eqn{\tau} (default = 1e-5), used when \code{method.optim = "Brent"}. See Details.
}
  \item{taumax}{
the upper bound of search space for the variance component parameter \eqn{\tau} (default = 1e5), used when \code{method.optim = "Brent"}. See Details.
}
  \item{tauregion}{
the number of search intervals for the REML or ML estimate of the variance component parameter \eqn{\tau} (default = 10), used when \code{method.optim = "Brent"}. See Details.
}
  \item{verbose}{
a logical switch for printing detailed information (parameter estimates in each iteration) for testing and debugging purpose (default = FALSE).
}
  \item{\dots}{
additional arguments that could be passed to \code{\link{glm}}.
}
}
\details{
Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) are fitted using the penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) method proposed by Breslow and Clayton (1993). Generally, fitting a GLMM is computationally expensive, and by default we use the Average Information REML algorithm (Gilmour, Thompson and Cullis, 1995; Yang et al., 2011) to fit the model. If only one relationship matrix is specified (\code{kins} is a matrix), iterations may be accelerated using the algorithm proposed by Zhou and Stephens (2012) for linear mixed models. An eigendecomposition is performed in each outer iteration and the estimate of the variance component parameter \eqn{\tau} is obtained by maximizing the profiled log restricted likelihood (or likelihood) in a search space from \code{taumin} to \code{taumax}, equally divided into \code{tauregion} intervals on the log scale, using Brent's method (1973). If \code{kins} is a list of matrices and \code{method = "Nelder-Mead"}, iterations are performed as a multi-dimensional maximization problem solved by Nelder and Mead's method (1965). It can be very slow, and we do not recommend using this method unless the likelihood function is badly behaved. Both Brent's method and Nelder and Mead's method are derivative-free. When the Average Information REML algorithm fails to converge, a warning message is given and the algorithm is default to derivative-free approaches: Brent's method if only one relationship matrix is specified, Nelder and Mead's method if more than one relationship matrix is specified.
